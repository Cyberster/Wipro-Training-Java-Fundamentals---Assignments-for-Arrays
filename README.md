	One dimensional Array 	
3 	

 Write a program to initialize an integer array with values and check if a given number is present in the array or not. If the number is not found, it will print -1 else it will print the index value of the given  number in the array
Ex1) Array elements are  {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 90
O/P: -1
Ex2)Array elements are  {1,4,34,56,7} and the search element is 56
O/P: 4

 Write a program to print the sum of the elements of the array with the given below condition. If the array has 6 and 7 in succeeding orders, ignore 6 and 7 and the numbers between them for the calculation of sum.
Eg1) Array Elements - 10,3,6,1,2,7,9
O/P: 22   
[i.e 10+3+9]
Eg2) Array Elements - 7,1,2,3,6
O/P:19
Eg3) Array Elements - 1,6,4,7,9
O/P:10

 Write a program to reverse the elements of a given 2*2 array. Four integer numbers needs to be passed as Command Line arguments.

Example1:

     C:\>java Sample 1 2 3

     O/P Expected : Please enter 4 integer numbers

Example2:

     C:\>java Sample 1 2 3 4

     O/P Expected : 
     
  The given array is :
  1 2 
  3 4 
  The reverse of the array is :
  4 3 
  2 1

Example1:

     C:\>java Sample 1 2 3

     O/P Expected : Please enter 9 integer numbers

Example2:

     C:\>java Sample 1 23 45 55 121 222 56 77 89

     O/P Expected : 
The given array is :
